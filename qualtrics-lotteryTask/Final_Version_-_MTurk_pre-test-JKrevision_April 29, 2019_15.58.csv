You are in a group of 4 participants. Each of you has 10 ECU and is requested to make a decision on how to invest the 10 ECU.

 
There is a private account and a group account. You have to choose how much you want to invest in the group account. The remaining ECU that you choose not to invest in the group account will be invested in the private account. For each ECU invested in the private account, you will receive 1 ECU (= 1:1 ratio). Each ECU invested in the group account will yield 3 ECU for the group (= 1:3 ratio). 



Each person in the group will receive an equal share (one-4th) of the money in the group account regardless of the individual contribution. Every group member can decide independently how much to invest in the group account.

You must decide whether you would like to invest up to 10 ECU in the following lottery:

 

There is a 1/6 (17%) chance that the lottery will “succeed” and you will make 7 times the amount you invested. There is a 5/6 (83%) chance the lottery will “fail” and you will lose the money you invested.

 

Whether the lottery succeeds or fails will be determined as follows: you are assigned the number 6 as your ""success number"". After you indicate the amount you would like to invest in the lottery, you will be taken to a page where you will click to roll a six-sided die. If the outcome is your “success number” (1/6 chance) then the lottery will succeed and you will make seven times (7x) the amount you invested.  If the outcome is any other number (5/6 chance) then you will lose the amount you invested.
